Web App Template: "AI Daily Pulse"

I. Core Goal:
Display a curated feed of significant AI news, research, and developments published or detected within the last 24-48 hours.

II. Key Components & Logic (No-Code Platform Setup):

Data Sources (APIs & Integrations):

Why: You need external services to provide the AI news/developments. Direct scraping is complex and often violates terms of service. APIs are the way to go.
Setup:
News APIs: Integrate with one or more news APIs that allow topic filtering (e.g., "artificial intelligence", "machine learning").
Examples: NewsAPI.org, GNews API, Webz.io (more advanced/costly), Mediastack. Configure the API connector in your no-code platform with your API key. Set the query parameters to search for relevant AI terms.
Tech-Specific News Sources (via RSS or API): Many AI-focused blogs/sites offer RSS feeds.
Examples: TechCrunch (AI section), Wired (AI section), MIT Technology Review (AI section), AI News (artificialintelligence-news.com). Use a "Fetch RSS Feed" action or an RSS-to-JSON converter service if your platform doesn't directly support RSS in workflows.
Research Papers (API/Targeted Source):
Example: ArXiv API (requires understanding its query format). Search for categories like cs.AI, cs.LG, stat.ML. This is more technical but provides cutting-edge research. Alternatively, monitor RSS feeds from specific university AI labs or curated research summaries if available.
(Optional) Social Media Monitoring:
Example: Use an integration service like Zapier or Make.com connected to your no-code platform to monitor specific Twitter hashtags (e.g., #AI, #LLM, #OpenAI) or influential accounts. This is harder to filter precisely for "developments."
(Optional) Specialized AI/ML APIs: APIs like those from Google Cloud AI or Microsoft Azure might offer specific news or trend features, though they are often more focused on providing AI services.
Data Storage (Internal Database/Collection):

Why: You need a place to store the aggregated information before displaying it.
Setup: Create a database table/collection (e.g., "AI_Updates") within your no-code platform with fields like:
Title (Text)
Source_Name (Text - e.g., "TechCrunch", "ArXiv", "GNews")
URL (URL/Text)
Published_Date (Date/Timestamp)
Summary (Text - often provided by the API)
Category (Text - Optional: e.g., "Research", "Industry News", "Model Release")
Processed_Date (Date/Timestamp - When your app fetched it)
Backend Workflow / Automation:

Why: This is the core logic that fetches, filters, and stores the data.
Setup: Create a scheduled workflow (most no-code platforms support this) set to run periodically (e.g., every hour, or every few hours, up to once daily depending on desired freshness and API limits).
Workflow Steps:
Trigger: Scheduled time (e.g., daily at 1 AM) or when the user wants. There should be an option to trigger immediately
API Calls: For each configured data source (News API, RSS Feed fetch, ArXiv API call):
Make the API request.
Specify query parameters (keywords: "artificial intelligence", "machine learning", "LLM", etc.).
Crucially, specify date parameters if the API supports it (e.g., publishedAfter = Current Time minus 24 hours). Note: Not all APIs/RSS feeds allow precise date filtering in the request.
Loop & Filter: For each item received from an API call:
Extract Title, URL, Published_Date, Summary, Source_Name.
Date Filter (Mandatory): Check if the Published_Date is within the last 24 hours (or your desired window, like 48 hours to be safe). If not, skip this item. This is critical if the API couldn't pre-filter by date. Most no-code platforms provide date comparison functions ("Date > Current Time - 24 hours").
De-duplication Check: Check if an item with the same URL or Title already exists in your "AI_Updates" database. If yes, skip this item.
(Optional) AI Summarization/Categorization: If using an AI integration (like OpenAI API connector), you could potentially send the article text/summary to an AI model to generate a shorter summary or assign a category. This adds complexity and cost.
Store Data: If the item passes filters, create a new record in your "AI_Updates" database table with the extracted information.
(Optional) Clean Up: Add a step to delete old records from "AI_Updates" (e.g., items older than 7 days) to keep the database size manageable.
Frontend User Interface (UI):

Why: This is what the user sees and interacts with.
Setup: Design a simple web page using the no-code platform's visual editor.
Page Title: "AI Daily Pulse" or similar.
Date Display: Show the current date or the time range covered (e.g., "Updates from the last 24 hours").
Repeating Group / List Element: This is the main display area.
Data Source: Connect this element to your "AI_Updates" database table.
Sorting: Sort the data by Published_Date (newest first).
Filtering (UI Level): While the backend workflow does the main time filtering, you might add UI filters for the user (e.g., filter by Source_Name or Category if you implemented that).
Display within each list item:
Title (Make it a clickable link using the URL field).
Source_Name.
Published_Date (formatted nicely, e.g., "X hours ago" or "MMM DD, YYYY").
Summary.
(Optional) Refresh Button: A button that could potentially trigger the backend workflow manually (though scheduled updates are usually better).
(Optional) Filtering/Search Bar: Allow users to search titles or filter by source/category.
III. Local Setup vs. Online Deployment:

Local: Most true no-code platforms are cloud-based by nature. You build and preview them through your web browser. There isn't usually a "local run" in the traditional software sense. You'd test using the platform's preview/development mode. Some platforms like Retool or Appsmith can be self-hosted, which is closer to a local setup, but requires more technical setup (like Docker).
Online Deployment: No-code platforms are designed for easy deployment. Usually, it's a one-click "Publish" button. You'll get a URL hosted by the platform (e.g., yourapp.bubbleapps.io) or you can connect a custom domain (www.yourdomain.com) once you upgrade to a paid plan.
IV. Considerations & Refinements:

API Costs & Rate Limits: Many APIs have free tiers but limit the number of requests per day/month. Aggregating frequently from many sources might require paid plans.
Data Quality & Relevance: API results can be noisy. You might need to refine your search keywords or add negative keywords (e.g., exclude "artificial insemination" if it appears). Filtering purely by keywords might miss conceptual developments.
"Development" Definition: Defining what constitutes a "development" is subjective. This template primarily captures published news and research. Tracking things like model performance improvements without explicit announcements is much harder.
Scalability: No-code platforms have different performance tiers. If your app becomes very popular or processes vast amounts of data, you might need to upgrade your plan.
No-Code Platform Choice: Select a platform known for strong API integration, reliable scheduled workflows, and flexible data handling (Bubble, Retool, Xano (backend) + Webflow (frontend), Noodl are often mentioned in this context).
This template provides a solid foundation. You'll need to adapt it based on the specific features and interface of the no-code platform you choose. Good luck!
